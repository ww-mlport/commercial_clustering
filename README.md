### ML Clustering of Commercial Users Daily Electricity Consumption Profiles
#### Summary:
* The growth of intermittent electricity generation sources, such as wind, solar etc., on electricity grids has increased the challenge of balancing supply and demand. Instead of increasing supply to meet demand, shifting or curtailing demand using time-of-use tariffs and demand-side response (DSR) has become increasingly important.
* In order to offer the appropriate time-of-use tariff and DSR products and incentives to users, it is useful for electricity suppliers and operators to have a clear understanding of user profiles. Fairly simple user categorisation based on industry or business type (e.g. office, grocer, school etc.) are insufficent as there can be significant variation in consumption profiles within these categories.
* The hypothesis of this study is that a machine learning clustering approach can provide more suitable and insightful user categorisation.
#### Aim:
* Cluster commercial electricity users based on consumption profiles using feature extraction (PCA) and machine learning clustering algorithms.
#### Data:
* Anonymized 5-minute electricity usage data for 100 commercial/ industrial sites for 2012 (Available at:https://open-enernoc-data.s3.amazonaws.com/anon/index.html).
* Commercial users in the dataset are currently categorised according to industry and sub-industry.
#### Methodology:
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms
